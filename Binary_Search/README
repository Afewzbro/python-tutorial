binary search:
If you have a sorted list and you want to search this array for something,
You could go through each item in the list and ask, is this equal to what we're looking for?
But we can make this *faster* by leveraging the fact that our array is sorted!
Binary search ~ O(log(n)), naive search ~ O(n)
We will prove that binary search is faster than naive search!

binary search uses divide and conquer!
